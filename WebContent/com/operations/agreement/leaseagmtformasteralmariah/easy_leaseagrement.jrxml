12.3.	The Lessee may, subject to the Lessor’s prior written consent, terminate this Agreement before the Expiry Date, provided that the Lessee pays the Lessor the equivalent of one month’s Fee for each year of the Term remaining as at the date of termination. The minimum charge hereunder shall be 1 months’ Fee and the maximum chargeable shall be 3 months’ Fee. The Lessee hereby consents to such charges and deems them a reasonable and proportionate amount to cover the administrative expenses and interim loss the Lessor will experience as a result of the early termination. The Lessee hereby agrees that such amount is a reasonable pre-estimate of the losses the Lessor will likely suffer as a result of Lessor’s agreement to the early termination of this Agreement. 




13.1.	Upon the Expiry Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement the Lessee shall:

a)	within two (2) calendar days, pay to Lessor all outstanding Fees and Expenses plus interest (if applicable), where after Lessor shall return any Post Dated Cheques that have not been encashed;

b)	immediately return the Vehicle(s) to the Location;  and

c)	cease all use of any confidential information in its possession and shall make necessary arrangements to deliver to Lessor, in accordance with such reasonable instructions as may be given by Lessor, all written, graphic, electromagnetic, computerized, digital, or other materials, whatsoever, comprising or containing any confidential information, within seven (7) calendar days of such expiry or termination. To the extent that any such Confidential Information cannot reasonably be delivered to Lessor, the Lessee agrees and undertakes to destroy any such confidential information and shall certify such destruction in writing to Lessor within seven (7) calendar days of the expiry or earlier termination of this Agreement.

13.2.	The expiry or earlier termination of this Agreement shall not of itself give rise to any liability on the part of the Lessor to pay any compensation to the Lessee, including but not limited to, for loss of profits, business or goodwill.

13.3.	The accrued rights and remedies of the Parties as at the Expiry Date, or earlier termination date, shall not be affected, including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of this Agreement which existed at or before the date of expiry or earlier termination.

13.4.	Clauses which expressly or by implication have effect after termination shall continue in full force and effect.




14.1.	Lessor may at any time assign, transfer or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights under this Agreement and may subcontract or delegate in any manner any or all of its obligations under this Agreement to any third party. The Lessee shall not, without the prior written consent of Lessor, assign, transfer, charge, subcontract or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement.

14.2.	Any notice or other communication required to be given to a Party under or in connection with this Agreement shall be in English and in writing and shall be delivered to the other Party personally or sent by commercial courier or sent by fax or email to the other Party, to the address as set out in this Agreement(or such other address, fax or email as either Party notifies to the other from time to time). Any notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly received if delivered personally, when left at such address or if delivered by commercial courier, on the date and at the time that the courier's delivery receipt is signed, or if sent by fax or email on the next Business Day after transmission. 

14.3.	A waiver of any right under this Agreement is only effective if it is in writing and shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor preclude or restrict its further exercise. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
