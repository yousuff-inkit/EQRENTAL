<p align="justify"><b><u>Terms and Conditions.</u></b></p>

<p align="justify"><b>Abudhabi supplies and commercial services-Sole proprietorship LLC</b>  (referred to as <b>"ASCS"</b>, "we", "us" or "our") rents the vehicle (including any replacement vehicle) to you subject to this Rental Agreement, which incorporates these terms and conditions and the information and conditions contained on the Rental Record that you have signed and on the Rental Wallet. In making this rental you accept the terms of the Rental Agreement and confirm that you will strictly comply with them.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;NATURE OF THIS AGREEMENT</b><br/>
1.1- The rights and obligations contained in this Rental Agreement govern your use of our vehicle and are not transferable by you. You acknowledge that the vehicle is owned by us and that any attempted transfer or sub rent of the vehicle by anyone other than us is void. We permit you to use the vehicle on the terms and conditions of this Rental Agreement only</p>

<p align="justify"><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;WHO MAY DRIVE THE VEHICLE</b><br/>
2.1 - The vehicle must only be driven by you or any other person who has first been authorised by us and added to the Rental Record and you agree that you will not allow anyone to drive the vehicle, including yourself:<br/>
2.1.1 - who does not fulfil our minimum requirements regarding age and possession of a valid driving licence as indicated for the relevant rate or otherwise notified by us; or<br/>
2.1.2 - who is over-tired or under the influence of alcohol, drugs, medication or any other legal or illegal substance impairing their consciousness or ability to react.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;PICK-UP, DELIVERY AND RETURN</b><br/>
3.1 - We will supply the vehicle to you in good overall and operating condition, complete with all necessary documents, parts and accessories.<br/>
3.2 - You agree to return the vehicle to us in the same condition as you rented it, subject to fair wear and tear, with the same documents, parts and accessories, at the location and on the date and time designated in this Rental Agreement.<br/>
3.3 - You and we will check the condition of the vehicle at the start of the rental and on return of the vehicle. An ASCS representative will provide a record showing any agreed defects. You acknowledge that you will be responsible for any loss or damage to the vehicle, its documents, parts or accessories arising during the rental.<br/>
3.4 - The vehicle must be returned to the agreed ASCS location within the normal business hours of the location concerned. If you return the vehicle outside of these hours you must comply with the out of hours return instructions for that location, in which case you will remain fully responsible for the vehicle until the location re-opens for business. If you fail to comply with these instructions, you will remain responsible for the vehicle until we are able to access it.<br/>
3.5 - If at any time we have agreed that you may return the vehicle to a place other than an ASCS rental location, or if we have agreed to collect it, you will remain fully responsible for the vehicle until it is collected by us.<br/>
3.6 - Our rental charges are calculated on the basis of 24 hour periods from commencement of the rental. If you fail to return the vehicle to the agreed return or collection point at or before the vehicle return time stated on the Rental Record, you will be charged an extra day's rental at the relevant daily rate, including charges for any options taken, for every day or part of a day that the car is overdue. This charge is subject to any additional time (or 'grace period') allowed for return by prior agreement with us or in accordance with our current policy (please ask at the rental location for details).<br/>
3.7 - You agree that we are entitled to charge you a reasonable additional cost if the vehicle requires more than our standard cleaning on its return to restore it to its pre-rental condition allowing for fair wear and tear.<br/>
3.8 In the cases of a lease vehicle, you agree to return any replacement vehicle within 24 hours of notification of readiness of leased vehicle, and default thereof to accept charges applicable to such replacement vehicle, in addition to the lease rate.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE</b><br/>
4.1 - Subject only to any deductions arising from your acceptance of any of the options specified at paragraph 4.2 you will be liable to us for all reasonable losses and costs incurred by us in the event of loss, damage to or theft of the vehicle, its parts or accessories while on rental. Your liability may include the cost of repairs, loss in value of the vehicle, loss of rental income, towing and storage charges and an administration charge, which recovers our costs for handling any claim arising from damage caused to the vehicle unless responsibility for the damage lies with us or has been determined by a third party or their insurers to lie with the third party. If, in our judgement, any damage makes the vehicle unfit for rental, we will endeavour to repair the vehicle as soon as possible. You will not be liable to us for any charge or excess if the loss or damage is directly due to our negligence or breach of this Rental Agreement.
4.2 - Provided you comply with all the terms of this Rental Agreement and provided the loss, damage or theft is not caused intentionally, or by the gross negligence of you or an authorised driver, or by any unauthorised driver, your liability may be limited as follows:<br/>
